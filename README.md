agda2lagda: Convert program to literate program (Agda/Haskell)
==============================================================

Generate a literate Agda/Haskell script from an Agda/Haskell script.
Produces LaTeX or Markdown literate scripts.

Conversion into LaTeX (default):

- Single line comments are turned into ordinary LaTeX.
  * Paragraphs followed by a line of equal signs are turned into `\heading`s.
  * Paragraphs followed by a line of dashes are turned into `\subheading`s.
  * Consecutive paragraphs starting `*` are turned into an `itemize` environment.
  * At the end of the file, extra block comment terminators are removed.

- Comment blocks, if started on the 0th column, count as _commenting out_.
  These will be turned into TeX comments.
  Nested comments are not recognized.

- The rest is interpreted as code and wrapped in a `code` environment.

Conversion into Markdown (option `--markdown`):

- Single line comments are turned into ordinary text.
  * At the end of the file, extra block comment terminators are removed.

- Comment blocks, if started on the 0th column, count as _commenting out_.
  These will be turned into HTML comments.
  Nested comments are not recognized.

- The rest is interpreted as code and wrapped in a code environment (triple backticks).

## Installation

These are standard installation instructions.

Last update of installation instructions: 2023-01-11.

### From stackage.org

Requires [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/).
```
stack update
stack install agda2lagda
```

### From hackage.haskell.org

Requires GHC >= 8.0 and the Haskell Cabal.
```
cabal update
cabal install agda2lagda
```

### From the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/andreasabel/agda2lagda.git
cd agda2lagda
cabal install
```
Alternatively to the last line, you can use `stack`.
E.g. if you have GHC 8.10.7 installed, you can use this compiler as follows:
```
stack install --system-ghc --stack-yaml stack-8.10.7.yaml
```
Alternatively, `stack` can install the compiler for you:
```
stack install --stack-yaml stack-xx.yy.zz.yaml
```
The `xx.yy.zz` is a placeholder for the GHC version,
choose one (for which there is a `.yaml` file).

At the time of writing, installation with these GHC versions has been tested:
8.0.2, 8.2.2, 8.4.4, 8.6.5, 8.8.4, 8.10.7, 9.0.2, 9.2.5, 9.4.4.
